# React-Employee-Directory

This project was built off of React framework library in order to create an employee directory application.
React Dom was used to create different sections in this application so that when a user clicks on a certain page,
it will direct them there. When a user types in the last name of an exisiting Employee, then that employees name will 
show with their information and contact.
